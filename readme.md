# Foro Korczak Microsite

This is a microsite the summarises the 'Foro Korczak' (Korczak Forum), an event meant to reflect about the innovation in superior education. The event was organized by the CAE+E, an institute from the Javeriana University of Colombia.

I had two roles in this project:
1. UI Designer.
2. Front-End Developer.

I used Illustrator to design the site and create the Mockups. Then, I used Sublime Text to write the code (HTML/CSS/JS). I used Bootstrap 3, FontAwesome 4 and SCSS.
