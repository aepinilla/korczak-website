# Foro Korczak Microsite

This is a microsite the summarises the 'Foro Korczak' (Korczak Forum), an event meant to reflect about the innovation in superior education. The event was organized by the CAE+E, an institute from the Javeriana University of Colombia.

My role consisted on designing the microsite and programming it. I used Bootstrap.
